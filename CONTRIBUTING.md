# Contributing to Aspect Computing!
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Requesting Deprecation

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. This repo is used to help and support others.

## All changes made here happen through pull requests. Here's our procedures to do this!

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## This repo has both software and hardware within one space. Pleasee mark issues and pull requests with the appropriate tags, so that the correct people will review it.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
While I am not a fan of *Perscriptive* coding, we would like to have consistant coding styles within this repository.

* 1 tab for indentation rather than spaces
* For code, keep open curly brackets [ { ] on the same line as it's following control statement.
ex:
```cpp 
if(i == 0){
  // Code here!
} else {
  //Else Here!
}
```
* Keep variable names understandable.

## Hardware:
* Keep traces clean. Reduce overlapping.
* Use net-labels when possible.

### Rule of thumb:
* If unsure, just do it how you know how to. It can always be fixed later!
