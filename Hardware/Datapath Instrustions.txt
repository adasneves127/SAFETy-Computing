Datapath controller will connect to control unit

Datapath instructions will come in from CU. Controller will then process what needs to happen.

Datapath Instructions:

let our 8 bit binary number be represented as such:

abcdefgh

If a, b, and c == 0, then the instruction will be a instruction for the registers.

Otherwise, it will be an instruction for the ALU

Register Instructions:


000000xx -> Put register xx onto the data line.

0000xx00 -> Put data bus data into register xx.

0001xxyy -> Put data from register yy into xx.


ALU Instructions:

abcdxxyy, where xx is the register to store in, and yy is the register to add from.


ABC:
001 -> LSL
010 -> LSR
011 -> CMP

ABCD:

1000 -> Add
1001 -> Sub
1010 -> Inc
1011 -> Dec
1100 -> Add-imm
1101 -> Sub-imm
1110 -> Inc-imm
1111 -> Dec-imm
