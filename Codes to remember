Used Categories:
    A -> Arithmetic Addition
    B -> Arithmetic Subtracting
    C -> Register operands

Arithmetic Operations:
    Adding:
        All operands will start with A
        Even Number means Immediate Command
        Odd Numbers means non-immediate command
        Incrementing will fall under this category
    Subtracting:
        All operands will start with B
        Even Numbers following B will be Immediate
        Odd nums following B will be non-immediate
        Decrementing will fall under this category
Memory and Registers:
    Registers:
        LD(R): 11 (R) (MEM)
        LD(R): 101 (R) 000 (NUM)

        ST(R) 00 (R) (MEM)
        ST(R) 010 (R) 000 (NUM)

        T(R)(R) : 1101 (R) (R)
